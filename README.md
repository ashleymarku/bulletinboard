# bulletinboard

in the terminal do: 

npm install ejs
npm install express --save
npm install body-parsar

##### This should allow you to test and use the code


## After cloning the file

once you clone this repo, enter the files by CD-ing into then in the terminal and once in the "bulletin" folder type:

node src/app.js

###### this should run the app and in your terminal you should see "listening"

## after your app is running:

check the local port at the bottom of the app.js in your text editor, by default it is set to local port 3000. go to http://localhost:3000/bulletin
and you should see where it accepts input, after writing to the file it pushes to the info to the JSON file.

## What doesnt work:

we cant get the bulletin board to post the info from the JSON file to the localhost
